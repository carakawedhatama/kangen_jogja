This project was initially aimed for predicting the house price in D.I. Yogyakarta. And due to incomplete data (and yet, this is my warm up to code a machine learning again), so I changed the data set using Ames House Price data source.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have these stacks installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, etc)
- Django 4.2 or higher
- API tester (Postman, Thunderclient, Hoppscotch, etc)

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python .\predictor\data\training.py
```

This will train the model and save it to a file. To run the project, run the following command:

```bash
python .\manage.py runserver
```

## Data

The data for this project is from the Ames Housing dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset), which contains information about houses sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The dataset includes 79 features and 1 target variable (the sale price of the house).

The data is preprocessed by dropping irrelevant features, handling missing values, and one-hot encoding categorical features.

## Model

The model used in this project is a linear regression model. The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%. The evaluation metrics include mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.
By far, here's the initial evaluation metrics:

```bash
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 18853.724695430483
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1020363951.2054477
R-squared (RÂ²): 87.27%
```

## API

The project includes a simple API for making predictions using the trained model. To make a prediction, send a POST request to the following URL:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/predict/
```

The request should include the following form data:



Example for the body request:

```
MSSubClass=60&MSZoning=RL&LotArea=5000&Street=Pave&LotShape=Reg&LandContour=Lvl&Utilities=AllPub&LotConfig=Inside&LandSlope=Gtl&Neighborhood=NAmes&Condition1=Norm&Condition2=Norm&BldgType=1Fam&HouseStyle=2Story&OverallQual=7&OverallCond=5&YearBuilt=2003&YearRemodAdd=2003&RoofStyle=Gable&RoofMatl=CompShg&Exterior1st=VinylSd&Exterior2nd=VinylSd&ExterQual=TA&ExterCond=TA&Foundation=PConc&Heating=GasA&HeatingQC=Ex&CentralAir=Y&1stFlrSF=1000&2ndFlrSF=1000&LowQualFinSF=0&GrLivArea=2000&FullBath=2&HalfBath=1&BedroomAbvGr=3&KitchenAbvGr=1&KitchenQual=TA&TotRmsAbvGrd=6&Functional=Typ&Fireplaces=1&PavedDrive=Y&WoodDeckSF=100&OpenPorchSF=50&EnclosedPorch=50&3SsnPorch=0&ScreenPorch=0&PoolArea=0&MiscVal=0&MoSold=6&YrSold=2008&SaleType=WD&SaleCondition=Normal
```

The response will include the predicted sale price of the house.

Example for the response:

```json
{
  "price": 178709.64576348104
}
```
